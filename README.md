# NIMBLE
## AIM
The Aim of this App Nimble is to help Student post Ads to sell there
old books,notes,study material,etc. We also have a book store
section where one can buy books and see which books are
recommended. Apart from book selling we also have a Jubilate
section(Entertainment section) and a Study Material/Fileserver
Section. In the fileserver section we can post study material content
in form of text,pdf,image. The Entertainment Section has many sub-
apps for instance: Eathquake report,Weather report, Snakes &amp;
Ladder, Time counter,etc. Apart from this are app also has a help-
desk section that allows students to mail and chat with us (Admin).
We also added our Campus view and Maps to this app.
Overall we designed a multi-purpose app that allows students to
study through our platform and enjoy through our entertainment
section when in stress.
